Working on a C# calculator, with basics operators, usable "( )" for multiplications and "%" !

Changes in the future will occure to :
- allow the calculator to use "<" to remove the last number inputed (if a change is needed in the expression)
- define a bigger screen to make bigger expression (such as affine and linear function, exponential etc.)
- modify the UI to add edges to the calculator (to make it looks like a real one)

Goals in the future :
- make this c# calculator fully usuable for any kind of expression you could think about with a regular calculator
- give this calculator a better UI, and why not implement it on a ws with a design
