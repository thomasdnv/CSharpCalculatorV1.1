>> fixed an issue where the result of the calculation was displayed in both the C# Calculator title scree and the calculation screen

>> fixed an issue where a missing value in "AddMultiplicationWhenNeeded(string expression" that caused any result to be an invalid expression:


*** Error ***
 private static string AddMultiplicationWhenNeeded(string expression)
 {
     for (int i = 0; i < expression.Length ; i++)

*** Fix ***

 private static string AddMultiplicationWhenNeeded(string expression)
 {
     for (int i = 0; i < expression.Length -1; i++)

The missing "-1" made the calculation going out of bound (which is definitely not something you want)
